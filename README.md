## 🧠 Inspiration

> “All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original.”  
> — *Steal Like an Artist*, p. 7

This project is a remix of a classic idea:  
✅ Ask a silly question.  
✅ Always get the same answer: **"YES"**.  
✅ Make it tricolor. Make it fun. Make it shareable.
